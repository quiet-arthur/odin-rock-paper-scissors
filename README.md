# Odin: Rock Paper Scissors Project

## A project of a old school game "Rock Paper Scissors" source: The Odin Project.

### For this project were used the following features

* HTML5; 
* CSS3;
* JavaScript;

#### This project intuition was to review and use all the knowledge absorbed from the articles and classes taken on the TOP's JavaScript Path until Rock Paper and Scissors project. So it was pored some knowing of JS such as


* Functions;
* Event Listeners;
* Loops;
* If statements;

### How it was written

#### At first, the logic was implemented using JavaScript: 
    No much UI, only the code that could *get* the user selection and a function able to randomly choose a selection(computer).
    Then both choices were matched against each other so a winner could be selected.
    The result of the match would be printed on the screen by an alert message.

#### A UI and UX implemented
    Using the already made logic, the second part of the project was to create a more designed interface.
    So then, it was used button to *get* the user selection --using element.addEventListener function.
    And the HTML page was designed using CSS properties.

### Final notes
    It was such an incredibly project to create. Besides being able to use JS capabilities, I could've gotten a little further and use animations in the project.
